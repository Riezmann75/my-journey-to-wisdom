Hi there, I am a part-time Gold Valorant player, an ordinary person trying to figure out what I meant to be. I graduated from VinUniversity in Vietnam and my current stop is as a research engineer at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

This space will be a space for me to reflect on my thoughts, those could be my understanding on a paper, a personal perspective on life, etc. In the end, I hope to make this become a friendly stop for those who wandering.
